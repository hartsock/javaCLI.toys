An excuse to evaluate different CLI libraries.

Libraries to consider:
1. https://picocli.info/ (a personal favorite)
2. https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell 
3. https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/ (a de facto standard)

Problems to solve/consider
* how do I showcase multiple frameworks like this in one project?
* do I need to rewrite each example for each framework or can I do something more clever?
* can this be a good interview project?
